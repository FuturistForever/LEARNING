# Learning Repository

Welcome to the **LEARNING** repository! This is a collection of programs and projects across various programming languages as I explore and build my coding skills.

## Languages Covered
- **C++**: Fundamental concepts, functions, classes, problem-solving techniques.
- **Python**: Basics, logical operations, projects, and more to come.
- **More to Come!** As I learn new languages, theyâ€™ll be added here.

## Structure
Each language has its own folder:
- **C++/**: Contains C++ programs.
- **PYTHON/**: Contains Python programs.

## Programs Included
### C++
- Basic Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus)
- Area and Volume Calculations (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Cube, Cylinder, Sphere)
- Prime Number Checker (Using Loops & Class)
- Student Information Management (Using Class & Objects)
- GCD Calculation (Using Functions)
- Temperature Conversion (Fahrenheit to Centigrade & Vice Versa)
- And Many More!

### Python
- Simple Calculator
- Random Number Guessing Game
- Multiplication Table Generator
- Prime Number Checker
- Mad Libs Game
- More Projects Coming Soon!

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bugOpsX/LEARNING.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd LEARNING
   ```
3. Choose the language folder, then run the desired program:
   - **C++:** Compile and run with a C++ compiler:
     ```bash
     g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
     ./program_name
     ```
   - **Python:** Run directly with Python:
     ```bash
     python program_name.py
     ```

## Future Plans
- Add more programming languages.
- Build larger projects combining different concepts.
- Document each program with explanations.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
