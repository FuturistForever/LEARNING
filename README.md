# LEARNING

Welcome to *LEARNING*! This repository contains various C++ programs covering fundamental concepts, functions, classes, and problem-solving techniques.

About This Repository
This repository is a collection of C++ programs that I am working on to improve my programming skills. It includes:
- Basic Syntax & Operations
- Functions (inline, overloading, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arithmetic & Mathematical Operations
- Prime Number Checking
- Area & Volume Calculations
- Student Information Handling
- File Handling (coming soon!)

## Programs Included
1. *Basic Arithmetic Operations* (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus)
2. *Area and Volume Calculations* (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Cube, Cylinder, Sphere)
3. *Prime Number Checker* (Using Loops & Class)
4. *Student Information Management* (Using Class & Objects)
5. *GCD Calculation* (Using Functions)
6. *Temperature Conversion* (Fahrenheit to Centigrade & Vice Versa)
7. **And Many More!**
